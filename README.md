## What is this? 

A bolt torque calculator. It has two modes: Basic and Advanced. Basic uses data from various manufactuerer bolt torque charts, whereas advanced calculates torque using T = KDF, and some user inputted information. 

## Toolchain

Create react app, and it's various components, along with semantic-ui. (Well, react-semantic-ui anyways). 
Also, using query-strings and react-router to get query strings in the URL as an API. Not sure if anyone 
is interested in using this from another application but it's nice to provide that anyway.  

## Why? 

My cousin thought it might be useful and I needed some projects to throw on my portfolio. Also, it's been
good as a learning experience / practice experience after going through various JS / React / dev courses.
