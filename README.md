## What is this? 

Just a react app/site that provides a helpful dropdown interface, 
returning the torque for a bolt depending on various variables. 

## Toolchain

Create react app, and it's various components, along with 
semantic-ui. (Well, react-semantic-ui anyways)

## Why? 

My cousin thought it might be useful and I needed some projects
to throw on my portfolio.
