## What is this? 

A bolt torque calculator. It has two modes: Basic and Advanced. Basic uses data from various manufactuerer bolt torque charts, whereas advanced calculates torque using T = KDF, and some calculations based on user inputted info. 

## Toolchain

Create react app, and it's various components, along with semantic-ui. (Well, react-semantic-ui anyways). 
Also, using query-strings and react-router to get query strings in the URL as an API. Not sure if anyone 
is interested in using this from another application but it's nice to provide that anyway.  

## Why? 

My cousin thought it might be useful and I needed some projects to throw on my portfolio. Also, it's been
good as a learning experience / practice experience after going through various JS / React / dev courses. 

## How does it work? 

Basically, it stores user inputted dropdown / integers in a react context api store, and either calculates (advanced) 
or accesses a large object (basic) to get the correct torque for your entered variables. 

## To Do

* I'll probably remove basic altogeather and simply let advanced calculate everything. 
* Additional ISO bolt sizes, need to find more data for proofLoad and what not. 
* Additional standards (ASTM? Others?) may be integrated in the future. 

That's pretty much it for the app. Maybe I'll slap it on it's own domain and add an ad or something, 
but we'll see.
